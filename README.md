# Datawiz-Streaming-Platforms

DATAWIZ PROJECT
Steven LE MOAL & Natacha Batmini BATMANABANE DIA1

We have chosen 3 datasets:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney

Part 1 : Context and motivation

Ruchi Battia, a Kaggle user scrapped a list of movies available on various streaming platforms (the first dataset). She also did the same with TV shows on streaming platforms (the second one).

The 4 streamings platforms are:
    Netflix
    Hulu
    Prime Video
    Disney+

We will use the 3rd dataset to merge with the country field to retrieve the location for graphing with a map.

We'll try to answer this question:
How do viewer preferences, movies and TV series characteristics and platform availability relate to each other? What are the strategies of the 4 platforms?
